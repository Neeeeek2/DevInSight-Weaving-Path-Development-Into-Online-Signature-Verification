Official implementation of the paper **"DevInSight: Weaving Path Development Into Online Signature Verification"**, accepted at **ICDAR 2025**.

DevInSight is a novel **automatic online handwritten signature verification model** that introduces a trainable [**Path Development (Dev)**](https://github.com/PDevNet/DevNet) module as its core component.


## ðŸ“Œ Overview
The main contributions of this paper are as follows:

- We propose a robust online handwritten signature verification model based on Path Development and DTW, effectively addressing challenges in cross-session verification. We build online signature representation model by hier-archically stacking Dev layers, and build DTW-based verifier upon.

- We enhance the representation performance of Dev by introducing several techniques, including Windowing Strategy, Grouping Strategy and Absolute-Information-Augmentation. Furthermore, we propose the Local Focus Module (LFM) based on the enhanced Dev to effectively capture local correlations, and the Global Fusion Module (GFM), which leverages GRU to capture long-term dependencies in time series features.

- Experiments on two large datasets in different languages demonstrate compet-itive performance of DevInSight compared to existing methods. Furthermore, we extend our model to handwritten digit string verification, demonstrating its ability to generalize to other forms of handwritten content.
